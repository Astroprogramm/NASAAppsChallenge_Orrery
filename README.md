# Our celestial community ☀️

## High-Level Summary

I developed an interactive web page featuring a 3D orrery model of the Solar System, designed to make complex astronomical information accessible and engaging for the general public. The web app offers a user-friendly interface, enhanced with visuals and music, allowing users to explore celestial bodies such as planets, and small bodies. By leveraging modern technology, my project brings the traditional orrery model into the digital age, providing an immersive and educational experience for users. This interactive orrery web app addresses the challenge of making astronomy more approachable and enjoyable for a broader audience, promoting a deeper understanding of our Solar System and its wonders.

## The challenge:

##### Create an Orrery Web App that Displays Near-Earth Objects

Since a mechanical model of the solar system was presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713, such models have been referred to as orreries. The first orreries were physical models, but today we can use numerous tools to create virtual orreries that have many more features than their ancient mechanical counterparts. Your challenge is to create an interactive orrery web app that is embedded in a webpage and displays celestial bodies such as planets, Near-Earth Asteroids, Near-Earth Comets, and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.

##### Project Details

### Introduction

Welcome to SkySphere, an innovative web application designed to provide an immersive and educational experience for users interested in exploring our solar system. This interactive orrery web app offers a unique blend of engaging visuals, music, and informative content, making complex astronomical information accessible to a broader audience.

### How it Works

SkySphere utilizes a combination of cutting-edge technologies, including Streamlit, Astroquery, Plotly, Python, and HTML, to create an interactive and user-friendly interface. The app allows users to explore a 3D orrery model of the Solar System, featuring celestial bodies such as planets and minor bodies. With its intuitive design, users can easily navigate through the app, discovering fascinating facts and insights about our celestial neighbors.

### Benefits and Problem-Solving

SkySphere addresses the challenge of making astronomy more approachable and enjoyable for the general public. By providing an immersive and interactive experience, the app encourages users to develop a deeper understanding of our Solar System and its wonders. The app's engaging visuals and music enhance the learning experience, making it an excellent resource for educational institutions, astronomy enthusiasts, and anyone curious about the universe.

### Goals and Future Developments

The primary goal of SkySphere is to inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity about the universe, while providing a valuable educational resource for users of all ages. Future developments include expanding the app's features to include additional celestial bodies, incorporating real-time data, and enhancing the user interface to accommodate a wider range of devices and platforms.

### Tools and Technologies Used

To develop SkySphere, the following tools, coding languages, hardware, and software were utilized:

Streamlit: A Python library for building web applications

Astroquery: A Python package for querying astronomical databases

Plotly: A Python library for creating interactive, web-based visualizations

Python: A high-level programming language for developing the app's core functionality

HTML: A markup language for customizing the Streamlit interface

### Use of Artificial Intelligence

Yes, I utilized Ninja Tech AI to assist in preparing my project. Specifically, I used it to generate the initial plot after obtaining data from astroquery, to modify some visuals on my app, and to help craft a clear and engaging project description, ensuring a professional and polished presentation of my work.
